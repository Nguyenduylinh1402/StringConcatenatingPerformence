1.	Giới thiệu về cái String Concatenating Performance
There are (at least) three ways to concatenate several String objects in Java. Given the strA and strB String objects, those three ways are:

-	strA + strB
-	strA.concat(strB)
-	new StringBuilder(strA).append(strB)
What’s the difference? In this case, not much. The + operation internally calls to StringBuilder.append

Example:
 String str = "Hello, " + "my " + "name " + "is " + "Javier.";
Is translate to:
String str = new StringBuilder("Hello ").append("my ").append("name ")
    .append("is ").append("Javier.").toString();

 It is more important when we are processing mass of data and loop a logic performing strings concatenating. 

for (int idx = 0; idx < fNumIterations; idx++) {
			result = result + "blah";
		}
	Is translate to:
for (int idx = 0; idx < fNumIterations; idx++) {
			result = new StringBuilder(result).append("blah");
		}

The code generated by the compiler instantiates too many StringBuilder objects, invokes too many methods, and instantiates too many String objects.
